This is very hacky but it seems to mostly work.

First, create a Mac OS user dedicated to Open Interpreter (or don't if you want to go full Yolo).
Log in to that account and then you'll also want to create an Apple ID for them â€” this enables outbound messages. Go ahead and text yourself to make sure it's working.
Make sure you have Open Interpreter and other libraries (see below) installed.
Update the two lines under # Hardcoded variables as appropriate.

On modern versions of Mac OS, you'll also have to:

* Give Terminal Full Disk Access. Open settings and search "Full Disk Access" and something should pop up. You'll have to restart Terminal for this to take effect.
* I also gave Full Disk Accesss to Tmux, but this isn't strictly necessary, it was just very annoying when I was trying to remoteley fix things.
* Under settings, it can also be helpful but probably not necessary to turn on remote login, especially if you're ssh'ing in.
* Save this file where you want open interpreter to "live" and then run python openinterpreter_via_imessage.py
* Save your OpenAI key as a universal variable (Open Interpreter is usually good at helping you do this) so you don't have to save it here.

The first time you run it, you might need to manually click OK in a few places, and you'll probably also want to have run open interpreter previously, but other then that just send the email address associated with open interpreter an iMessage and it should hopefully respond.
